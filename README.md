# Square-Lattice-Reaction-Kinetics-Crowded-Environments
Matlab code for simulations of paper "Reaction kinetics in intracellular environments with macromolecular crowding: simulations 
and rate laws" [Prog Biophys Mol Biol 85 (2004) 235â€“260]. This code was originally created by Thomas E. Turner. For more information, 
we recommend to read the paper on: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2004.01.012. Please cite our paper if you use our code.
